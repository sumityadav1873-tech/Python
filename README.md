# This project demonstrates data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation using Python (Pandas & NumPy).
The dataset contains information about employees, their seniority levels, and the projects they manage.
The goal is to build clean, well-structured DataFrames from raw data, perform transformations, handle missing values, apply business logic (like promotions/demotions), and generate meaningful outputs.and then perform real-world style data cleaning, transformation, and rule-based processing.
The project simulates how data analysts handle incomplete information, enforce business rules, and generate insights using tools like Pandas and NumPy.
ðŸ”¹ Description of the Project
- The project starts with three different datasets: Employee, Seniority Level, and Project.
- Each dataset contains complementary details such as employee information, their roles, and the projects they are associated with.
- The main tasks involved creating DataFrames, handling missing data, merging information, and applying business logic (like promotion, demotion, and bonuses).
- Step by step, the project demonstrates how raw datasets can be turned into a clean, well-structured, and insightful final dataset.
ðŸ”¹ Main Features of the Project
- Data Creation & Storage â€“ Built multiple DataFrames and exported them to CSV format.
- Data Cleaning â€“ Handled missing values with custom logic (running averages).
- Data Transformation â€“ Split columns, reformatted text, and applied conditional changes.
- Merging & Integration â€“ Combined multiple datasets into a single final view.
- Business Logic Implementation â€“ Added rules like promotions, demotions, and bonus calculations.
- Aggregation & Reporting â€“ Calculated total project costs per employee.
- Filtering & Selection â€“ Queried specific records based on conditions like city names.
- Automation with Loops & Conditions â€“ Applied logic using Python loops and if-statements.
